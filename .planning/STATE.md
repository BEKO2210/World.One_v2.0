# Project State

## Project Reference

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Infrastructure-first build order -- data layer and utilities before any detail page content
- [Roadmap]: CO2 + 4 diverse topics prove pattern before scaling (not just CO2 alone)
- [Roadmap]: Main page modifications deferred to Phase 9-10 to avoid touching production until detail pages are proven
- [Roadmap]: Phase 3 (Actions) can run in parallel with Phase 2 (Detail Shell) since both depend only on Phase 1
- [Phase 01]: Chart.js CDN loader uses singleton promise pattern with jsDelivr primary/cdnjs fallback, dark defaults applied before any chart creation
- [Phase 01]: createChart is synchronous; callers must await ensureChartJs() first to keep registry predictable

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Chart.js exact 4.x patch version must be verified at CDN load time
- [Research]: CORS compatibility of NOAA/NASA APIs must be browser-tested in Phase 4
- [Research]: GitHub Actions minutes budget needs real measurement after first cache workflow runs
