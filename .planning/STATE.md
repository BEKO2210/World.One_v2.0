# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-21)

**Core value:** Every number on the dashboard becomes explorable -- users click any data point and get rich, interactive context with live data, historical trends, and visual explanations. No data point is ever invisible or broken.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Data Layer & Utilities

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 10 (Data Layer & Utilities)
Plan: 3 of 3 in current phase
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-03-21 -- Completed plan 01-03 (Chart Manager)

Progress: [##########] 100%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: 3min
- Total execution time: 0.15 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| Phase 01 P01 | 3min | 2 tasks | 3 files |
| Phase 01 P02 | 2min | 2 tasks | 1 files |
| Phase 01 P03 | 2min | 2 tasks | 1 files |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 3min, 2min, 2min

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Infrastructure-first build order -- data layer and utilities before any detail page content
- [Roadmap]: CO2 + 4 diverse topics prove pattern before scaling (not just CO2 alone)
- [Roadmap]: Main page modifications deferred to Phase 9-10 to avoid touching production until detail pages are proven
- [Roadmap]: Phase 3 (Actions) can run in parallel with Phase 2 (Detail Shell) since both depend only on Phase 1
- [Phase 01]: Standalone data-loader module separate from existing js/data-loader.js
- [Phase 01]: Module-level cache for static-values.json (fetched once, reused)
- [Phase 01]: ESM imports in validation script to match project type:module convention
- [Phase 01]: Chart.js CDN loader uses singleton promise pattern with jsDelivr primary/cdnjs fallback, dark defaults applied before any chart creation
- [Phase 01]: createChart is synchronous; callers must await ensureChartJs() first to keep registry predictable
- [Phase 01]: Badge uses inline-flex pill design with BEM naming (.data-badge + variant modifiers), stale threshold at 24h

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Chart.js exact 4.x patch version must be verified at CDN load time
- [Research]: CORS compatibility of NOAA/NASA APIs must be browser-tested in Phase 4
- [Research]: GitHub Actions minutes budget needs real measurement after first cache workflow runs
